## Projects

A list of my recent projects:

### Coinchaser

> Coinchaser is a game made with pygame I made in spring 2021 in my first year learning Python. Coinchaser was inspired by Snake, Pacman and a few other "old school" games. More information to this game you can find in the Github repository

**Important:**

The game is not up to date and can have a lot of bugs

[Link to repository](https://github.com/chraebsli/pygame)

### Netlify

> Netlify isn't really a project but it is a collection for my web projects.

**Content:**

_Home:_  
In the home folder there is my self made homepage. Its in german because I am Swiss. The only big code block I copied from the internet is the JS for the formulars. The rest was made by hand without any frameworks.

_Coinchaser:_  
Coinchaser is a website for the leader board for my project [Coinchaser](#coinchaser). Since the project is inactive, the linking between the website and the game. The website uses a JSON file to display the content.

_Todo:_  
Todo is the latest project im working on. It will be a web application to write down todos. The data will be stored in cloud and should be connected with accounts. The design and the functions are inspired by [Tasksboard.com](https://tasksboard.com)

_Portfolio old:_  
This is the first portfolio I made. It is very simple but I don't wanted to delete it.
