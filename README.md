## Projects

A list of my recent projects:

### Coinchaser

> Coinchaser is a game made with pygame I made in spring 2021 in my first year learning Python. Coinchaser was inspired by Snake, Pacman and a few other "old school" games. More informations to this game you can find in the Github repository

**Important:**

The game is not up to date and can have a lot of bugs
